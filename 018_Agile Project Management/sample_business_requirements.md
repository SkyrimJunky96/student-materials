# Title

## Executive Summary

*Our goal is to build a web application to bring students together in the projects they are working on. Wether they be new ideas entirely or scraps of projects that just need an outside perspective. Students will be able to create new projects, as well as find existing ones to help others with.*

*A social platform will be included to let students interact with eachothers projects and help find solutions.*

## Business Objectives

*The number one priority of this project will be the student interaction system. Students should be able to view other projects and their problems, and be able to provide their personal solution to the project for support.*

*Business objectives should offer the details for why the project is important.  Outline the goals of the project in the sense of the value it will bring and set expectations.  Keep your objectives measurable to avoid confusion in whether or not they have been met.*

## Background

*This project is being initiated as a learning guide for Project management skills in the project development environment.*

## Scope

*This project will allow students to connect with eachother to talk about their projects. All students will be able to look through the existing projects in their entirety and make suggestions on what to change or how to fix certain issues.*

*Students will NOT be able to change the code of any project unless they are given the right permissions by the projects creaters.*

## Functional requirements

*User registration and login. Two different types of users (Admin, and Student) Admin will be able to see who is posting and what they are posting. They will also be able to remove inappropriate posts that don't adhere to common social guidelines. Students will be able to create profiles and add interests that they have to better match them with other students and projects. They will also be able to create new projects as well as add comments to existing projects.*

*Projects will be created individually by the students as well as edited by the students. *

*This is where most of the detail should reside.  describe all of the required capabilities of the system in detail.  It is helpful to articulate features in terms of user capabilities.  Keep in mind that the features will be designed and developed off of these descriptions, so if you leave anything up to interpretation, you run the risk of the results not meeting your expectations.  You can also assume capabilities that are not mentioned here will not be included in the project, no matter how common or obvious they are.  You may want to break our subsections for each major feature to make the document more organized.*


## Personnel requirements

*In this section you may want to describe the composition of the team, do you need dedicated development?  how many people?  How about design or QA?  Think about what personnel is required to make this project a success, and place your recommendations here.*

## Delivery schedule

*It's often helpful to break a project out into phases or milestones.  In this section list out any logical checkpoints where you would like to see the project demonstrated to ensure that expectations are being met.  Describe the phase, and the functional requirements required for completion.*

## Other requirements

*This section serves as a catch-all for any details that may not fit in other areas.  things like device or browser support, considerations for accessibility or inspiration for style.  Offer additional context here to ensure the project meets your vision*

## Assumptions

*Oftentimes we are reliant on outside sources such as frameworks to be used, or services that our system will depend on.  In this section you should provide detail on any assumptions that you have made, such as the system being reliant on the availability of the Google Maps API.*

## Limitations

*Identify any limitations in terms of time, personnel, technical details, or other things that limit the scope, time, and cost of the project being discussed.*

## Risks

*Every project has inherent risks that may cause delay or even failure of a project.  You must identify this risks to show you know what they are, and also identify ways in which you would mitigate those risks.*
