# Title

## Executive Summary

*Our goal is to build a web application to bring students together in the projects they are working on. Wether they be new ideas entirely or scraps of projects that just need an outside perspective. Students will be able to create new projects, as well as find existing ones to help others with.*

*A social platform will be included to let students interact with eachothers projects and help find solutions.*

## Business Objectives

*The number one priority of this project will be the student interaction system. Students should be able to view other projects and their problems, and be able to provide their personal solution to the project for support.*

*Business objectives should offer the details for why the project is important.  Outline the goals of the project in the sense of the value it will bring and set expectations.  Keep your objectives measurable to avoid confusion in whether or not they have been met.*

## Background

*This project is being initiated as a learning guide for Project management skills in the project development environment.*

## Scope

*This project will allow students to connect with eachother to talk about their projects. All students will be able to look through the existing projects in their entirety and make suggestions on what to change or how to fix certain issues.*

*Students will NOT be able to change the code of any project unless they are given the right permissions by the projects creaters.*

## Functional requirements

*User registration and login. Two different types of users (Admin, and Student) Admin will be able to see who is posting and what they are posting. They will also be able to remove inappropriate posts that don't adhere to common social guidelines. Students will be able to create profiles and add interests that they have to better match them with other students and projects. They will also be able to create new projects as well as add comments to existing projects.*

*Projects will be created individually by the students as well as edited by the students. *

## Personnel requirements

*Ideally for the most efficient use of time we would have at least 5 people on this project. Two small teams of 2 people and an extra person for database development and over seeing the rest of the project. The teams of two would work on front end and back end respectively.*

## Delivery schedule

*DAY 1. Team 1 begins work on front end while team two and PM get database started. DAY 2. Team 1 finishes up the actual functionality of the front end space. Team 2 begins work on back end and implentation of datebase. DAY 3. Team 1 touches up the design of front end UI. Team 2 and PM connect front end and back end functionality. DAY 4. Whole team product testing and bug finding. DAY 5. Whole team finishes up final pre release bug fixes.*

## Other requirements

*This section serves as a catch-all for any details that may not fit in other areas.  things like device or browser support, considerations for accessibility or inspiration for style.  Offer additional context here to ensure the project meets your vision*

## Assumptions

*Using Angular and Express for Front end and backend respectively.*

## Limitations

*Identify any limitations in terms of time, personnel, technical details, or other things that limit the scope, time, and cost of the project being discussed.*

## Risks

*Every project has inherent risks that may cause delay or even failure of a project.  You must identify this risks to show you know what they are, and also identify ways in which you would mitigate those risks.*
